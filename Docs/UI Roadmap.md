#UI Roadmap
This is the roadmap for the UI, this roadmap is particularly directed at the creation and early versions of the UI for commissionator until it catches up with V3 of the model, at this point the model will be updated to match any changes needed and the controller will be created to bridge the two parts together. Development will then continue as usual.
